# Supermarket
We build a Django prototype in Python to improve revenues for Supermarket data.

Our Dataset has information about product details, purchases, demographics, coupons. Using this, our goal is to improve revenues by targeting Segments in the Dataset.

We use dunnhumby's data for a Supermarket.

___________________________________________________________

#### Data Set:

This dataset contains household level transactions over two years from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a retailer. It contains all of each householdâ€™s purchases, not just those from a limited number of categories. For certain households, demographic information as well as direct marketing contact history are included.

Below is the link for whole data-Set:

## DATA TABLES:
The following contains the structure of the Dataset, which we used for the whole prototype.

We use (a) to denote that a record is connected to another table.
